# 389. Find the Difference
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
Example 4:

Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lower-case English letters.


# Solution:
1. hash map loop through first string, and store letters and their count in map. Loop through second string and see if each letter is in map if yes subtract from the count, otherwise the leftover is the difference
2. XOR operator: finds the bitwise difference, flips the bits, know some properties:
   1. anything XOR 0 is itself
   2. anything XOR itself is 0
so since string s and t are duplicates with just 1 letter difference if we XOR through all the int values of each number then the left over will be the extra letter.
